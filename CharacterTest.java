/**
Program Purpose: Practice designing a class.

Program Function: This program designs a class for an RPG game character. The class has accessor and mutator methods along 
with a couple other methods used to manipulate character attributes and have characters take actions.

Note: CharacterTest is the wrapper class containing the main method, while the Character class has the blueprint for the 
game character's member variables and methods.
